\section{Motivation \& Lecture Goals}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{Motivation \& Lecture Goals}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item This lecture is aimed at showing how \jade{}-like agents can be constructed from scratch
		%
		\begin{itemize}
			\item we will build a simple framework for MAS execution $\ldots$
			\item $\ldots$ to be extended in future lectures with interaction- and distribution-related features
		\end{itemize}
		
		\bigskip
		
		\item Building an agent framework requires defining, at least:
		%
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item how agents are executed, created, stopped, or paused (and therefore resumed)
			\item how agents may carry on several \emph{behaviours}, concurrently
			\item how agents may \emph{interact}, possibly in spite of distribution
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{About the practical activities}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lab \labN{} Repository on GitLab}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Examples and exercises described in this lecture are provided by means of the following GitLab repository:
		%
		\begin{center}
			\url{\labRepo}
		\end{center}
		
		\vfill
		
		\item Clone it on your machine using Git
		%
		\begin{itemize}
		    \item[\$] \texttt{git clone \textit{<repo URL>}}
		\end{itemize}
		
		\vfill
		
		\item Even if a minimal environment simply relying on a text editor + Gradle is sufficient for this lab, we kindly suggest to import the cloned repository into some IDE, e.g. IntelliJ Idea or Eclipse
		%
		%
		\begin{itemize}
		    \item in case of problems in importing the project on IntelliJ, try to downgrade the gradle wrapper
		\end{itemize}
		
		\vfill
		
		\item In order to be able to submit your exercises, please ensure you requested access to the \href{\labGroup}{GitLab group of the course}

\subsection{Metamodel}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{Metamodel}

	\begin{block}{MAS}
	    We consider a MAS to be composed by a number of agents \alert{interacting} within an environment
	\end{block}

	\bigskip
	
	\begin{block}{Environment}
		We consider an Environment as a container of agents, exposing \emph{shared} facilities aimed at \alert{supporting} the agents' \alert{creation}, and \alert{interaction}
	\end{block}
	
	\bigskip
	
	\begin{block}{Agent}
	    We consider an Agent as an object (data + behaviour) coming with its own \alert{internal scheduler} aimed at executing an arbitrary amount of \alert{behaviours} concurrently
	\end{block}
	
	\bigskip
	
	\begin{block}{Agents' Finite State Machine (FSM)}
		We assume each Agent is moved by an internal FSM aimed supporting life-cycle management operations such as: \emph{start}, \emph{restart}, \emph{pause}, \emph{resume}, \emph{stop}	
	\end{block}
	
	\bigskip
	
	\begin{block}{Behaviours}
		We consider a Behaviour as an atomic or composite action an agent may carry on, concurrently (w.r.t. other Behaviours)
	\end{block}
	
	\bigskip
	
	\begin{block}{Agents' Interaction}
		Any means letting an agent affect the operation of other agents.
		Can be achieved in several ways (message-passing, shared-memory, stigmergy, etc).
		%
		\begin{center}\bfseries
			(we will endow agents with interaction in future lectures, via \linda{})

    \begin{itemize}
        \item All agents from within the same environment \alert{share} the same \texttt{ExecutorService}
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item we call it \alert{engine} since it is responsible for all computations actually occurring within the system
        \end{itemize}
        
        \vfill

            \item each possible name is \alert{virtually} bound to a tuple space
            %
            \begin{itemize}
                \item instances of tuple spaces are \alert{actually created} upon first usage

        \item Agents can either
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item be created outside the environment and then join it thorugh \alert{registration}
            %

\begin{frame}{Agent -- Naming}

For practical reasons, agents have two names:
%
\vfill
%
\begin{description}
    \item[local name] can be any string, but it must be \alert{unique} within the environment the agent is situated into

    % \begin{block}{Agent VS User perspectives}
    %     The functioning of agents can be described and understood according to two different perspectives:
        
    % \end{block}
    
    Expected functioning of all objects of type \alert{\texttt{Agent}}:
    %
    \vspace{.5cm}
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the agent is created by some other entity as an ordinary Java object
        
        \vspace{.5cm}
        
        \item the agent may be started from outside by means of the \texttt{Agent::\alert{start()}} method 
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item this is the only tolerated exception to control encapsulation
        \end{itemize}
        
        \vspace{.5cm}
        
        \item once started, the following things should happen:
        %
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item the \texttt{Agent::\alert{onBegin()}} callback is executed \alert{just once}
            
            \item \alert{after} that, the \texttt{Agent::\alert{onRun()}} method is executed an \alert{unlimited} amount of times, sequentially
    
            \item the sequence of executions of \texttt{onRun()} can only be interrupted by the agent itself by calling the \texttt{Agent::\alert{stop()}} method inside its \texttt{onBegin()} or \texttt{onRun()} callbacks
        \end{enumerate}
        
        \framebreak
        
        % \item if the agent calls its \texttt{Agent::\alert{pause()}} method, the sequence of \texttt{onRun()} is interrupted as well
        
        % \vspace{.5cm}
        
        % \item however, if some external entity calls the 
        % \texttt{Agent::\alert{resume()}} method on a paused agents, the sequence of \texttt{onRun()} is resumed \alert{from where it had been interrupted}
        
        % \vspace{.5cm}
        
        % \item if the agent calls its \texttt{Agent::\alert{restart()}} method, the sequence of \texttt{onRun()} is restarted---and the \texttt{onBegin()} method is executed one more time
        
        % \vspace{.5cm}
        
        % \item finally, external entities can wait for an agent's termination by means of the \texttt{Agent::\alert{await()}} method and its overloads
        
        % \framebreak
        
        % \item in any scenario, if some \alert{uncaught exception} is thrown within the \texttt{onBegin()} or \texttt{onRun()} methods, the \texttt{Agent::\alert{onUncaughtError(Exception)}} callback is called
        
        % \vspace{.5cm}
        
        % \item what happens next depends on the value returned by the \texttt{onUncaughtError(Exception)} callback, which is of type \alert{\texttt{AndThen}}
        % %
        % \begin{description}
        %     \item[\texttt{CONTINUE}] | the exception is ignored and the sequence of \texttt{onRun()} is unaffected

        % \end{description}
        
        \item after that, the agent \alert{terminates}---which means that all entities which possibly invoked the \texttt{Agent::\alert{await()}} method, can now resume their computation
        
        \vspace{.3cm}
        
        \item within its \texttt{onBegin()}, \texttt{onRun()}, or \texttt{onEnd()} methods, an agent can call the following methods affecting its own control flow and, in particular, the sequence of \texttt{on*()} methods executions:
        %
        \begin{description}\small
            \item[\texttt{stop()}] states that the next method to be executed should be \texttt{onEnd()}
            
            \item[\texttt{restart()}] states that the next method to be executed should be \texttt{onBegin()}
            
            \item[\texttt{pause()}] states that no method should be executed next, until \texttt{resume()} is called
            
            \item[\texttt{resume()}] states that the sequence of \texttt{on*()} methods executions should be resumed starting from where it was interrupted by the \texttt{pause()}
        \end{description}
        
        \framebreak

        \vspace{.3cm}
        
        \item to this end, \texttt{Agent::\alert{onUncaughtError(Exception)}} method is executed for each excpetion which is not caught within the \texttt{onBegin()}, \texttt{onRun()}, or \texttt{onEnd()} methods
        
        \vspace{.3cm}
        
        \item the \texttt{onUncaughtError(Exception)} method returns an object of type \texttt{AndThen} stating what should happen next:
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item in case \texttt{AndThen.\alert{CONTINUE}} is returned, the aforementioned workflow continues as if the exception didn't occurred
            
            \item in case \texttt{AndThen.\alert{STOP}} is returned, the aforementioned workflow is interrupted as if \texttt{stop()} was invoked
            
            \item in case \texttt{AndThen.\alert{PAUSE}} is returned, the aforementioned workflow is interrupted as if \texttt{pause()} was invoked
            
            \item in case \texttt{AndThen.\alert{RESTART}} is returned, the aforementioned workflow is restarted as if \texttt{restart()} was invoked

\begin{frame}{External VS internal API}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{Agent} interface is actually the union of two API targetting different usages
    
    \vfill
    
    \item The \alert{external} API comprehends methods which are to be called \alert{from outside} the agent
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[eg] method \texttt{Agent::\alert{start()}}
        \item[eg] method \texttt{Agent::\alert{await()}}
        \item[eg] method \texttt{Agent::\alert{resume()}}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vfill
    
    \item The \alert{internal} API comprehends methods which are to be called \alert{from within} the agent itself
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[eg] method \texttt{Agent::\alert{stop()}}
        \item[eg] method \texttt{Agent::\alert{pause()}}
        \item[eg] method \texttt{Agent::\alert{pause()}}
        \item[eg] method \texttt{Agent::\alert{restart()}}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vfill
    
    \item Briefly speking, methods composing the \alert{internal} API can be called by agent implementors \alert{only} within the \texttt{on*()} callbacks
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item calling them elsewhere may lead to unexpected \& unpredicatable behaviour

        %
        \begin{description}
            \item[CREATED] | the agent has been instantiated but not yet started

        \item State transitions imply consuming some value of type \texttt{\alert{AndThen}} and executing a callback
        
        \vspace{.3cm}
        
        \item State transition are usually provoked by invocations of the \alert{control methods}

    \item In the Ping-pong example, agents are aware of their respective names, \alert{by construction}
    
    \vspace{.3cm}
    
    \item This is ok for examples, but \alert{it is not the case} in real world Distributed Systems
    
    \vspace{.3cm}
    
    \item There, a \alert{white pages} service is usually in place, letting \alert{discover} their peers, \alert{dynamically} 
    
\end{itemize}

\vspace{.3cm}

\begin{block}{TODO}
    Try editing the Ping \& Pong agents in such a way that they are able to \alert{discover} each others dynamically, \alert{before} starting the ping-pong protocol
\end{block}

\begin{exampleblock}{Some advices}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What about employing a \alert{tuple space} as white pages?
        
        \item Consider exploiting ``Negative Lookaheads'' in regular expressions
